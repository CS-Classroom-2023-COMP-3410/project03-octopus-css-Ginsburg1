Overll, I found this activty to be helpful when creating css files. After utalizing Chatgpt, I then went in and edited the information to make it look better. I went with the strategy going section by section to get chat gpt to make my different areas of the task.

I ended up haivng issues with chat gpt where it gave me small fixes to certain problems, but ended up having sytle conflicts with other sections. For example, When i wanted to make quiz go left and right, it did not format that correctly. I ended up going into office hours to resolve the confilct.

I feel that chatgpt is helpful, but has limitations. For making the overall design it is great, but once you have to make small changes, it conflicts itself to make small changes, but overall is confusing for debugging.
